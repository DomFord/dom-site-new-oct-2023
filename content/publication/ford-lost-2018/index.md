abstract: 'The long-lost, ancient civilisation that somehow had technology that far
  surpasses the current level is a common trope in videogames that feature large,
  open worlds. The textitMass Effect trilogy (2007; 2010; 2012) features the Protheans,
  whose unparalleled feats of technology and engineering such as the mass relays laid
  the foundations for the galaxy Shepard steps into. textitHorizon Zero Dawn (2017)
  explores a primitive world littered with technological marvels left by the Old Ones.
  textitThe Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild (2017) is centred around the Ancient
  Sheikah society, who 10,000 years prior to the game’s setting had developed teleportation
  between towers and shrines, powerful runes, and even a motorbike. Their technology
  was later used to build the giant mechanical Divine Beasts and Guardians. All this
  while the warriors of the day are still using steel swords. In this paper, I explore
  the reasons for and the effect of this trope in textitThe Legend of Zelda: Breath
  of the Wild, particularly how it changes the configuration of the gameworld, and
  how the player’s experience is shaped by it. My examination is framed around five
  intertwined terms and their theoretical context: Hauntology, presence, absence,
  lost futures, and nostalgia.'
