abstract: 'There’s an oft-quoted phrase in literature: “I didn’t have time to write
  a short letter, so I wrote a long one instead.” In its various forms and derivations,
  its origin is ambiguous, usually attributed to Mark Twain or Blaise Pascal. Who
  coined it is not too important; it makes a crucial point regardless. Anyone who
  has written an essay in school or university (and hasn’t loathed the subject) and
  had to contend with a word or page limit knows the feeling. It is hard to get your
  point, your image, your message across in a shorter number of words.'
